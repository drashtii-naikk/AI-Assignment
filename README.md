## Objective of the Project:
The objective is to analyze and optimize renewable energy usage by identifying consumption patterns, forecasting energy demands, and providing actionable insights to enhance efficiency, reduce carbon footprints, and support sustainable energy transitions.


# Tools and Libraries Used:
Programming Language : Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. numpy


## Data Source(s):
1. International renewable energy Agency:
2. U.S Energy information administration:
3. Renewable global status report:
4. International energy agency:


## Summary of Results:
The project focuses on leveraging AI to promote efficient and sustainable renewable energy usage. It involves analyzing energy consumption patterns, forecasting demand, and optimizing resource allocation for renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. By integrating real-time data and predictive modeling, the project aims to enhance energy efficiency, reduce dependency on non-renewable sources, and minimize environmental impact. The insights generated will support stakeholders, including energy providers and policymakers, in making data-driven decisions for a greener and more sustainable energy future.


## Challenges Faced:
During the development of the project, we encountered several challenges:

Data Quality Issues: The data was incomplete/dirty, which required significant preprocessing and cleaning.

Solution: We used to handle missing values and outliers.
Model Overfitting: Initially, our model was overfitting the training data.
